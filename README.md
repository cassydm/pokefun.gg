*This app is in demo version 0.0.1 with several future plans in development.*  

## Overview  

**Pokefun.gg (demo)** is an app that lets you search for a specific poke's info.  

The application is stored on **[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/cassydm/pokefun.gg)**.  

The app.py file holds all code information for the gradio application.  

## Future  

I have personal plans for future development including the following:  

> Search of specific poke abilities/moves/variants etc.  
> Development of a team builder, potentially using ML to suggest pokes for team building.  
> Development of a gradio game, where random pokes appear and the objective is to catch and get scored based on a variety of random factors.
